/**Given a two-dimensional integer list intervals of the form [start, end] representing intervals (inclusive), return their intersection, that is, the interval that lies within all of the given intervals.

You can assume that the intersection will be non-empty.

Constraints
1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of intervals

Example 1

Input
intervals = [
    [1, 100],
    [10, 50],
    [15, 65]
]

Output
[15, 50]

Explanation
Consider the ranges [1, 100], [10, 50], [15, 65] on a line. The range [15, 50] is the only interval that is included by all of them.
